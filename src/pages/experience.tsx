                    <h3>A summary of the coursework I've taken at the University of Virginia</h3>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Throughout my
                        academic journey, I have taken a variety of courses that have equipped me with a strong foundation
                        in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and mathematics. Some of the key
                        courses I have completed include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CS 2100 & 3100: Data structures and algorithms</li>
                        <li>CS 3710: Intro to Cybersecurity</li>
                        <li>CS 3140 & 3240: Advanced Software Engineering</li>
                        <li>CS 4760: Network Security</li>
                        <li>APMA 3080: Linear Algebra</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These courses have provided me with a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, software
                        engineering principles, operating systems, linear algebra, and probability. I am confident that the
                        skills and knowledge I have gained will be valuable in a professional setting and will enable me to
                        contribute effectively to any team.</p>
