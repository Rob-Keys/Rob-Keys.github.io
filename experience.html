<h2>Coursework</h2>
<h3>A summary of the coursework I've taken at the University of Virginia</h3>
<p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Throughout my academic journey, I have taken a variety of courses that have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and mathematics. Some of the key courses I have completed include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CS 2100 & 3100: Data structures and algorithms</li>
    <li>CS 3710: Intro to Cybersecurity</li>
    <li>CS 3140 & 3240: Advanced Software Engineering</li>
    <li>CS 4760: Network Security</li>
    <li>APMA 3080: Linear Algebra</li>
</ul>
<p>These courses have provided me with a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, software engineering principles, operating systems, linear algebra, and probability. I am confident that the skills and knowledge I have gained will be valuable in a professional setting and will enable me to contribute effectively to any team.</p>
